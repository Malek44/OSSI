Open Source Solar Inverter - Software, Hardware, Mechanics

This repository initially clones all content from the former Sourceforge hostet project site. Since the outages on Sourceforge became more frequently I decided to change over to Github which seems more reliable at this time.

This project aims to build an Open Source (Software and Hardware) Solar Inverter.
The goal is to design a solar inverter with parts that are available trough common distributors with no special manufactured parts.
All documentation (software, hardware, mechanics) is open and free to use by everyone.
Solar inverters can be very complex devices to build and there is a lot to learn on the way.
Join, collaborate, learn and help make the world a better place.
The sun shines for everyone! ðŸ˜Š

The current activities take place in the Wiki, where we collect the requirements.
(Currently the Wiki transfer is still delayed due to pending restore on Sourceforge  	â˜¹)
