This directory contains all schematics for the inverter.
It is planned to place all components on a single board (electronics and power electronics) since this is the best way to keep the costs down and keep the system complexity low.
Mulitple boards require connectors and cables. Connectors can go bad over time (corroding contacts due to moisture), cables add their own problems due to EMI and ground bounce. The connection between cable and connector is an additional source for failure.
